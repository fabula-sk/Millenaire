Millénaire is a Minecraft mod that aims to fill the "emptiness" left by the default Minecraft Villages by adding new NPC villages loosely based on 11th-century cultures. A village is populated by men, women, and children that each lives their own life and have their own story to tell.

## Development setup
This 1.14 version of Millénaire requires **Java 16**. To install the correct JDK
and prefetch dependencies, run:

```
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script installs OpenJDK 16 by default and works around a bug in
`ca-certificates-java` on minimal systems by creating a symlink at
`/lib/security/cacerts` if it is missing.
